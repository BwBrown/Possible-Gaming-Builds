		<a id="f">Does no one believe in me? Not even myself. And I scream out that nothing is wrong, but I can't help but wish for death to come. And is it really so wrong for me to be like this? To feel the things I feel, and think the things I think? Everyone says it is and it just... feels wrong, but I can't help myself. Dragged through the mud at the bottom of the sea... Is that where I belong for what I've done, for what I feel? Can I be fixed? I don't know. But it will end with my death. One less urchin, right? Maybe I should finish my book and start a new one.. One that focuses on these problems. But what's the point, really? People will get it, understand, sympethize, but what's the point? Just show everyone that I suffer every single day holding back a monster that wishes to consume the world and reap destruction? A monster with no redemption nor forgiveness. A ghoul that will rip your insides out just to feel something. Hey, maybe that's a good story. I don't know, man. It's all just too much. I think i've had enough.</a>
